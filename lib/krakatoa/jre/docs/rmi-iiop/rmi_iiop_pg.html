<!-- RMI-IIOP INTRODUCTION -->
<h2><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document discusses how to
write Java Remote Method Invocation
(RMI) programs that can access remote objects by using the Internet
Inter-ORB
Protocol (IIOP). By making your RMI programs conform to a small set of
<a href="#Restrictions">restrictions</a>,
your RMI programs can access
CORBA objects. RMI-IIOP gives you RMI ease-of-use coupled with
CORBA/IIOP language interoperability.</p>

<!-- WHAT IS RMI-IIOP? -->
<h2><a name="WhatIs"></a>What
is RMI-IIOP?</h2>
<h3>
RMI</h3>
<p>With RMI you can write
distributed programs in the Java programming
language.
RMI is easy to use, you don't need to learn a separate interface
definition
language (IDL), and you get Java's inherent "write once, run anywhere"
benefit. Clients, remote interfaces, and servers are written entirely
in
Java. RMI uses the Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) for remote Java
object
comunication. To get a quick introduction to writing RMI programs, see
the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/rmi">RMI
Tutorial</a> web page. That document
describes writing a simple "Hello
World" RMI program.
</p>
<p>RMI lacks interoperability with
other languages, and, because it uses
a non-standard communication protocol, cannot communicate with CORBA
objects.
</p>
<h3>IIOP, CORBA, and Java IDL</h3>
<p>IIOP is CORBA's communication
protocol. It defines the way the bits are
sent over a wire between CORBA clients and servers. CORBA is a standard
distributed object architecture developed by the Object Management
Group
(OMG). Interfaces to remote objects are described in a platform-neutral
interface definition language (IDL). Mappings from IDL to specific
programming
languages are implemented, binding the language to CORBA/IIOP.</p>
<p>The Java(TM) 2 Platform,
Standard Edition (J2SE) v1.4 CORBA/IIOP
implementation is known as Java IDL. Along with
the <tt>idlj</tt>
compiler, Java IDL can be used to define, implement,
and access CORBA objects from the Java programming language.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/idl/index.html">Java
IDL</a> web page gives you a good,
Java-centric view of CORBA/IIOP programming.
To get a quick introduction to writing Java IDL programs, see the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/idl/GShome.html">Getting
Started: Hello World</a> web page.
</p>
<h3>RMI-IIOP</h3>
<p>Previously Java programmers had
to choose between RMI and CORBA/IIOP
(Java
IDL) for distributed programming solutions. Now, by adhering to a few
<a href="#Restrictions">restrictions</a>,
RMI server objects can use the
IIOP protocol, and communicate with CORBA client objects written in any
language. This solution is known as RMI-IIOP. RMI-IIOP combines
RMI-style ease of use with CORBA cross-language interoperability.</p>
<h2><a name="rmic"></a>The
rmic Compiler</h2>
<p>The RMI-IIOP software comes
with an <tt>rmic</tt>
compiler that can
generate IIOP stubs and ties, and emit IDL, in accordance with the
<a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/01-06-07"><i>Java
Language
to OMG IDL Language Mapping Specification</i></a>.</p>
<p>Here are the <tt>rmic</tt>
flags that provide support for RMI-IIOP:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <b>-iiop</b></dt>
    <dd>
Generates IIOP stubs/ties</dd>
    <dt>
      <b>-iiop -poa</b></dt>
    <dd>
Generates IIOP stubs/ties that work with a Portable Object Adapter
(POA).</dd>
    <dt>
      <b>-idl</b></dt>
    <dd>
Generates IDL</dd>
    <dt>
      <b>-always</b></dt>
    <dd>
Forces re-generation even when existing stubs/ties/idl are newer than
the
input class. Only valid when -iiop and/or -idl flags are present.</dd>
  </dl>
In addition the following options may be used along with the
  <tt>-idl</tt>
option:
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <b>-noValueMethods</b></dt>
    <dd>
Stops generation of IDL for methods and constructors within IDL
valuetypes</dd>
    <dt>
      <b>-idlModule </b>&lt;<b><i>fromJavaPackage</i></b>&lt;.<b><i>class</i></b>&gt;&gt;
&lt;<b><i>toIDLModule</i></b>&gt;</dt>
    <dd>
Specifies IDLEntity package mapping.&nbsp; For example:</dd>
    <br>
-idlModule foo.bar my::real::idlmod
    <dt><b>-idlFile
      </b>&lt;<b>fromJavaPackage</b>&lt;.<b><i>class</i></b>&gt;&gt;
&lt;<b><i>toIDLFile</i></b>&gt;</dt>
    <dd>
Specifies IDLEntity file mapping.&nbsp; For example:</dd>
    <br>
-idlFile test.pkg.X TEST16.idl
  </dl>
</blockquote>
For more detailed information on the <tt>rmic</tt>
compiler refer to the
RMIC tool page
(<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/solaris/rmic.html">Solaris
Version</a>/<a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/win32/rmic.html">Windows
version</a>).
<h3>The -iiop Flag</h3>
<p>Using <tt>rmic</tt>
with the <tt>-iiop</tt>
option generates stub and tie
classes. A stub class is a local proxy for a remote object. Stub
classes
are used by clients to send calls to a server. Each remote interface
requires
a stub class, which implements that remote interface. The client's
reference
to a remote object is actually a reference to a stub. Tie classes are
used
on the server side to process incoming calls, and dispatch the calls to
the proper implementation class. Each implementation class requires a
tie
class.</p>
<p>Stub classes are also generated
for abstract interfaces. An abstract
interface is an interface that does not extend <tt>java.rmi.Remote</tt>,
but whose methods all throw either <tt>java.rmi.RemoteException</tt>
or
a superclass of <tt>java.rmi.RemoteException</tt>.
Interfaces that do not
extend
<tt>java.rmi.Remote</tt>
and have no methods are also abstract interfaces.
</p>
<h3>The -iiop -poa Flag</h3>
<p>New to this release of J2SE is
the <tt>-iiop
-poa</tt> option. Using
the <tt>-iiop</tt>
flag with the <tt>-poa</tt>
option changes the
inheritance from <tt>org.omg.CORBA_2_3.portable.ObjectImpl</tt>
to
<tt>org.omg.PortableServer.Servant</tt>.
<strong>This type of mapping
is nonstandard and is not specified by the
<a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/01-06-07"><i>Java
Language
to IDL Mapping Specification</i></a>.</strong></p>
<p>The <tt>PortableServer</tt>
module for the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/idl/POA.html">Portable
Object Adapter</a> (POA) defines the
native <tt>Servant</tt>
type. In
the Java programming language, the <tt>Servant</tt>
type is mapped to
the Java <tt>org.omg.PortableServer.Servant</tt>
class. It serves as
the base class for all POA servant implementations and provides a
number
of methods that may be invoked by the application programmer, as well
as
methods which are invoked by the POA itself and may be overridden by
the
user to control aspects of servant behavior.
</p>
<h3>The -idl Flag</h3>
<p>Using <tt>rmic</tt>
with the <tt>-idl</tt>
option generates OMG IDL for
the classes specified and any classes referenced. This option is only
required if you have a CORBA client written in another language that
needs to talk to a Java RMI-IIOP server.</p>
<p><strong>Note:
After the OMG IDL is generated using <tt>rmic
-idl</tt>, use the generated IDL
with an IDL-to-C++ or other language
compiler, but not with the IDL-to-Java language compiler. "Round
tripping" is not recommended and should not be necessary. The IDL
generation facility is intended to be used with other languages such as
C++. Java clients or servers can use the original RMI-IIOP
types.</strong>
</p>
<p>IDL provides a purely
declarative, programming language independent
means for specifying the API for an object.
The IDL is used as a specification for methods and data that can be
written in and invoked from any language that provides CORBA bindings.
This includes Java and C++ among others. See the
<a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/01-06-07"><i>Java
Language to IDL Mapping</i></a>
(OMG) document for a complete description.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>
The generated IDL can only be compiled using an IDL compiler
that supports the CORBA 2.3 extensions to IDL.
</p>
<h3>The -noValueMethods Flag</h3>
<p>The <tt>-noValueMethods</tt>
option, when used with <tt>-idl</tt>,
ensures
that methods and initializers are <i>not</i>
included in <tt>valuetype</tt>s
emitted during IDL Generation. These are optional for <tt>valuetype</tt>s
and are otherwise omitted.</p>
<h2><a name="idlj"></a>The
idlj Compiler</h2>
<p>
The RMI-IIOP software includes an IDL-to-Java compiler. This compiler
supports the CORBA Objects By Value feature, which is required for
interoperation with RMI-IIOP. It is written in Java, and so can run on
any platform. See the
<a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/rmi-iiop/toJavaPortableUG.html">IDL-to-Java
Compiler User's Guide</a> for
details of how to use this compiler.</p>
<!-- The RMI/IIOP COOKBOOK -->
<h2><a name="Convert"></a>How
to Make RMI Programs Use IIOP</h2>
<p>The following steps are a
general guide to converting an RMI
application
to RMI-IIOP.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>If you are using the RMI
registry</b> for naming services,
you need
to switch to <tt>CosNaming</tt>.
You need to do the following:</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
In both your client and server code, you need to create an <tt>InitialContext</tt>
for JNDI using the following code:</li>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; import javax.naming.*;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Context ic = new InitialContext();</pre>
    <li>
Modify all uses of RMI registry <tt>lookup()</tt>,
      <tt>bind()</tt>,
and
      <tt>rebind()</tt>
to use JNDI <tt>lookup()</tt>,
      <tt>bind()</tt>,
and <tt>rebind()</tt>
instead.
For example, instead of your RMI server using:</li>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; import java.rmi.*;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naming.rebind("MyObject", myObj);</pre>
use:
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; import javax.naming.*;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ic.rebind("MyObject", myObj);</pre>
    <li>
If the client is an applet, the client applet needs to pass <tt>this</tt>
to the JNDI <tt>CosNaming</tt>
plugin. Replace the above code with the
following:</li>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; import java.util.*;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; import javax.naming.*;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hashtable env = new Hashtable();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; env.put("java.naming.applet", this);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Context ic = new InitialContext(env);</pre>
  </ol>
  <li>
    <b>If you are not using the
RMI registry</b> for naming
services, you have
some other way of bootstrapping your initial remote object reference.
For
example, your server code may be using Java serialization to write an
RMI
object reference to an <tt>ObjectOutputStream</tt>
and passing this to
your client code for deserializing into an RMI stub. When doing this in
RMI-IIOP, it is also necessary to ensure that object references are
connected
to an ORB before serialization and after deserialization. The following
code example shows how to do this.<br>
    <br>
On the server side, use the <tt>PortableRemoteObject.toStub()</tt>
call
to obtain a stub, then use <tt>writeObject()</tt>
to serialize this stub
to an <tt>ObjectOutputStream</tt>.
If necessary, use
    <tt>Stub.connect()</tt>
to connect the stub to an ORB before serializing it. The code to do
this
looks something like:</li>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>org.omg.CORBA.ORB myORB = org.omg.CORBA.ORB.init(new String[0], null);<br>Wombat myWombat = new WombatImpl();<br>javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub myStub = (javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub)PortableRemoteObject.toStub(myWombat);<br>myStub.connect(myORB);<br>// myWombat is now connected to myORB.&nbsp; To connect other objects to the<br>// same ORB, use PortableRemoteObject.connect(nextWombat, myWombat);<br>FileOutputStream myFile = new FileOutputStream("t.tmp");<br>ObjectOutputStream myStream = new ObjectOutputStream(myFile);<br>myStream.writeObject(myStub);</pre>
  </blockquote>
On the client side, use <tt>readObject()</tt>
to deserialize a remote reference
to the object from an <tt>ObjectInputStream</tt>.
Before using the deserialized
stub to call remote methods, it must be connected to an ORB. You could
do this with code like:
  <blockquote>
    <pre>FileInputStream myFile = new FileInputStream("t.tmp");<br>ObjectInputStream myStream = new ObjectInputStream(myFile);<br>Wombat myWombat = (Wombat)myStream.readObject();<br>org.omg.CORBA.ORB myORB = org.omg.CORBA.ORB.init(new String[0], null);<br>((javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub)myWombat).connect(myORB);<br>// myWombat is now connected to myORB.&nbsp; To connect other objects to the<br>// same ORB, use PortableRemoteObject.connect(nextWombat, myWombat);</pre>
  </blockquote>
As you can see, the JNDI approach is much simpler, so use it whenever
possible.
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <li>Either change your remote
implementation classes to inherit from
    <tt>javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject</tt>,
or explicitly export
implementation objects after creation by calling
    <tt>PortableRemoteObject.exportObject()</tt>.
For more discussion on
this topic read <a href="#Connecting">Connecting
IIOP stubs to the
ORB</a>.</li>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <li>Change all the places in
your code where there is a Java cast of a remote
interface to use <tt>javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrow()</tt>.</li>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <li>Don't depend on distributed
garbage collection (DGC) or use any of the
RMI DGC facilities. Use <tt>PortableRemoteObject.unexportObject()</tt>
to unexport objects that are no longer in use.</li>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <li>Regenerate the RMI stubs and
ties using the <tt>rmic</tt>
command with
the <tt>-iiop</tt>
option. This will produce stub and tie files with the
following names:</li>
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _&lt;implementationName&gt;_Tie.class<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _&lt;interfaceName&gt;_Stub.class</pre>
  <li>
Before starting the server, start the <tt>CosNaming</tt>
server (in its
own process) using the following command:</li>
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tnameserv</pre>
This uses the default port number of 2809. If you want to use a
different
port number, use the following command:
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tnameserv -ORBInitialPort 1050</pre>
  <li>
When starting client and server applications, specify the following
system
properties:</li>
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java -Djava.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.CNCtxFactory<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Djava.naming.provider.url=iiop://&lt;hostname&gt;:2809<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;appl_class&gt;</pre>
This example uses the default name service port number of 2809. If you
specified
a different port in step 8, you need to use the same port number in the
provider URL here. The &lt;hostname&gt; in the provider URL is
the host name
that was used to start the <tt>CosNaming</tt>
server in step 7.
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <li>If the client is an applet,
specify the following properties in the applet
tag:</li>
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.CNCtxFactory<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java.naming.provider.url=iiop://&lt;hostname&gt;:2809</pre>
This example uses the default name service port number of 2809. If you
specified
a different port in step 8, you need to use the same port number in the
provider URL here. The &lt;hostname&gt; in the provider URL is
the host name
that was used to start the <tt>CosNaming</tt>
server in step 7.
</ol>
<h3>
<a name="Connecting"></a>Connecting
IIOP stubs to the ORB</h3>
<p>When your application uses IIOP
stubs, as opposed to JRMP stubs, you
need to properly connect the IIOP stubs with the ORB before invoking
operations on the IIOP stubs (this is not necessary with JRMP stubs).
This section discusses the extra 'connect' step required for the IIOP
stub case.</p>
<p><strong>The
<tt>PortableRemoteObject.exportObject()</tt>
call only creates a tie
object and caches it for future usage. The created tie does not have a
delegate or an ORB associated. This is known as explicit
invocation.</strong>
</p>
<p>The <tt>PortableRemoteObject.exportObject()</tt>
happens
automatically when the servant instance is created. This happens when a
<tt>PortableRemoteObject</tt>
constructor is called as a base class.
This is known as implicit invocation.
</p>
<p>Later, when <tt>PortableRemoteObject.toStub()</tt>
is called by the
application, it creates the corresponding Stub object and associates it
with the cached Tie object. But since the Tie is not connected and does
not have a delegate, the newly created stub also does not have a
delegate or ORB.
</p>
<p>The delegate is set for the
stub only when the application calls
<tt>Stub.connect(orb)</tt>.
Thus, any operations on the stub made before
the ORB connection is made will fail.
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/01-06-07"><i>Java
Language to IDL Mapping Specification</i></a>
says the following about
the <tt>Stub.connect()</tt>
method:
</p>
<blockquote>The <tt>connect</tt>
method makes the stub ready for remote
communication using the specified ORB object <tt>orb</tt>.
Connection
normally happens implicitly when the stub is received or sent as an
argument on a remote method call, but it is sometimes useful to do this
by making an explicit call (e.g., following deserialization). If the
stub is already connected to <tt>orb</tt>
(i.e., has a delegate set for
  <tt>orb</tt>),
then connect takes no action. If the stub is connected to
some other ORB, then a <tt>RemoteException</tt>
is thrown. Otherwise, a
delegate is created for this stub and the ORB object <tt>orb</tt>.
</blockquote>
<p>For servants that are not
POA-activated, <tt>Stub.connect(orb)</tt>
is necessary as a required setup.
</p>
<h2><a name="Restrictions"></a>Restrictions
When Running RMI Programs Over
IIOP</h2>
<p>To make existing RMI programs
run over IIOP, you need to observe the
following
restrictions.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
Make sure all constant definitions in remote interfaces are of
primitive
types or String and evaluated at compile time.</li>
  <li>
Don't use Java names that conflict with IDL mangled names generated by
the Java to IDL mapping rules. See section 28.3.2 of the
    <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/01-06-07"><i>Java
Language to IDL Mapping</i></a>
specification for the Java to IDL name
mapping rules.</li>
  <li>
Don't inherit the same method name into a remote interface more than
once
from different base remote interfaces.</li>
  <li>
Be careful when using names that differ only in case. The use of a type
name and a variable of that type whose name differs from the type name
only in case is supported. Most other combinations of names that differ
only in case are not supported.</li>
  <li>
Don't depend on runtime sharing of object references to be preserved
exactly
when transmitting object references across IIOP. Runtime sharing of
other
objects is preserved correctly.</li>
  <li>
Don't use the following features of RMI:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt>RMISocketFactory</tt></li>
    <li>
      <tt>UnicastRemoteObject</tt></li>
    <li>
      <tt>Unreferenced</tt></li>
    <li>
The Distributed Garbage Collector (DGC) interfaces</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<!-- OTHER THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW -->
<h2><a name="OtherThings"></a>Other
Things You Should Know</h2>
<h3>
Servers Need to be Thread Safe
</h3>
<p>
Since remote method invocations on the same remote object may execute
concurrently, a remote object implementation must be thread-safe.
</p>
<h3>Interoperating with Other ORBs</h3>
<p>RMI-IIOP should interoperate
with other ORBS that support the CORBA 2.3
specification. It will not interoperate with older ORBs, because these
are unable to handle the IIOP encodings for Objects By Value. This
support is needed to send RMI value classes (including strings) over
IIOP.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:
Although it is true that ORBs written in different

<h3>When do I use
UnicastRemoteObject vs PortableRemoteObject?</h3>
<p><tt>UnicastRemoteObject</tt>
should be used as the superclass for the
object implementation in RMI programming. <tt>PortableRemoteObject</tt>
should be used in RMI-IIOP programming. If <tt>PortableRemoteObject</tt>
is used, you can switch the transport protocol to either JRMP or IIOP
during runtime.
</p>
<h3>Known Problems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
JNDI 1.1 does not support
    <tt>java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.CNCtxFactory</tt>
as an Applet parameter.&nbsp; Instead, it must be explicitly passed
as a
property to the <tt>InitialContext</tt>
constructor. This capability is
supported in JNDI 1.2.</li>
  <li>
When running the Naming Service on Unix based platforms, you must use a
port number greater than 1024. The default port is 2809, so should
cause no problems.</li>
