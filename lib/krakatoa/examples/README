The examples in this directory include:

    * A couple Java user-defined functions demonstrating the use of the
        com.informix.udr interface:

        Env.java
        Env.sql

    * A user-defined function using server-side JDBC

        JDBC.java
        JDBC.sql

    * A user-defined function testing large objects w/ and w/o JDBC

        LO.java
        LO.sql

    * A user-defined type called "circle" implemented partly in Java

        Circle.java
        circle.h
        circle.c
        Circle.sql

Here are the steps for running the examples:

    1. Customize the URLs used by the install_jar calls in all SQL
        scripts. Replace "$INFORMIXDIR" with the directory where the Informix
        server is installed.

    2. Type "make" to build the examples. Make sure the following files are
       included in your CLASSPATH environment variable before attempting make -
       $INFORMIXDIR/extend/krakatoa/krakatoa(_g).jar
       $INFORMIXDIR/extend/krakatoa/jdbc(_g).jar
  
    3. Execute "run.sh" to run all examples.  Make sure you have created 
        your default smart blob space.
